My project will be titled "Streets of Chaos." In this game, the user will maneuver a stick figure character 
across a 2-dimensional gaming screen. He/she will be tasked with avoiding objects. There will be cars, planes, 
and soccer balls that will all be randomly moving across the screen. The user will jump and move in order to 
avoid being hit by one of these objects. The goal is to survive for 2 minutes in the game. Players will be 
given three lives. Once they lose all three of their lives, they lose the game. To win, one must have at least 
one life when time expires. There will be a city like background on the screen. Additionally, platforms will be 
placed enabling the user to more easily avoid being hit by one of the objects.

How To Play: Use the right and left arrow keys to move the user stick figure to the right and left, respectively. 
To jump, press the up arrow key. The object of the game is to avoid being hit by the cars, balls, and planes.
